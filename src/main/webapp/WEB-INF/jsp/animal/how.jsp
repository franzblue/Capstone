                <h1>How adoption works</h1>
                <p class="lead">Our friendly adoption staff will work with you to find the right dog, cat, or critter for your home.
                    Get started by checking our online adoption listings or stop by one of our three adoption centers in the Twin Cities metro area.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">It's important you spend time getting to know prospective pets.
                    If you have questions or wish to visit with an animal, just ask a staff member or volunteer for assistance.
                    For safety reasons, we ask that anyone 17 years old or younger is accompanied by an adult when visiting with an animal.</p>
